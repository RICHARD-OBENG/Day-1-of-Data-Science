# Concept
Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). The goal is to find the linear equation that best predicts the target variable from the feature variables.

The equation of a simple linear regression model is:
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \]
Where:
- \( y) is the predicted value.
- \( \beta_0) is the y-intercept.
- \( \beta_1) is the slope of the line (coefficient).
- \( x) is the independent variable.
